// When user submits input in the search bar, dynamically generate images based on the search query
// Reference Pexels for image search queries
// SwiperJS code to create Swiper rows for images
// Use slides per view to limit the amount of images displayed at once, maybe?
// How many images can the page load at once?
// utilize localStorage for persistence - previously searched list by that user, or previously viewed images?
